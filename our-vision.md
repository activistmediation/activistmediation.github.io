We want to co-create a world which responds to all levels of conflict in ways that increase wellbeing for everyone. Working with conflict in this way, with whatever support is needed, holds the potential for empowering groups working for change, as well as creating change within groups.

We want everyone to have easy access to the support that makes this possible. This might be through external mediators or facilitators, or through groups & communities themselves developing abilities and processes for handling conflict. 

We want to see the development of cultural and systemic conditions which support collaborative engagement with conflict.
