The Activist Mediation Network is a network of mediators based around the UK. We support groups working for social change to navigate through conflict and develop their own capacity to handle conflict. 

We do this by:

* Offering a **mediation service** for grassroots groups working for social change who are experiencing conflict and would like external support.

* Building and maintaining a **network of mediators**.

* Training groups to **develop skills to facilitate their own conflicts**

* Supporting groups to **develop & agree upon their own system and process for dealing with their conflicts**.

* **Shifting the culture** within social change movements towards greater willingness to work through and learn from conflicts within groups. Weâ€™d love to see skills for facilitating conflict being as highly valued as other skills.
