The Activist Mediation Network is a network of mediators based around the UK. We support groups in finding their own ways through conflict - we can facilitate your group through a conflict, or help you develop the capacity to do it yourself.

We use a range of methods to support groups working through conflict. We work to support everyone to speak and be heard, to understand and be understood, and to create the conditions for more awareness of what’s going on and what everyone is needing. This can lead to ways of moving forward together with better relationships and agreements which work for everyone.

Our approach to working with a group is evolving over time as we integrate new skills and experiences and as we explore new ideas in conflict facilitation. When we work with a group, we’ll explain the method we’re currently using, and we’ll adapt it to the needs of your particular situation. Between us we have training and experience in the following methods: 

* Community Mediation
* Restorative Circles
* Processwork (aka Process Oriented Psychology)
* Nonviolent Communication (NVC)
* Group Facilitation
* Consensus Decision Making
* Person-Centred Counselling

We have been involved in grassroots groups working for social change, and we support grassroots-led social change.
